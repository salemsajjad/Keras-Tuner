## Keras-Tuner
Keras Tuner is a library that helps you perform hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models built using Keras, which is a popular high-level neural network API written in Python. Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the best set of hyperparameters for your model to achieve optimal performance.

Here's a brief overview of how Keras Tuner works:

# 1. Define the Model:
Start by defining your model using the Keras API. This includes specifying the architecture, layers, activation functions, and any other relevant details.

# 2. Define the Hyperparameter Search Space:
Identify the hyperparameters that you want to tune and define their search spaces. These hyperparameters could include learning rate, number of units in a layer, dropout rates, etc.

# 3. Choose the Tuner:
Keras Tuner provides several tuners, such as RandomSearch, Hyperband, and BayesianOptimization. You need to choose a tuner based on your requirements. Each tuner explores the hyperparameter space in a different way.

# 4. Search for the Best Hyperparameters:
Use the selected tuner to search for the best hyperparameters. Keras Tuner will then train different combinations of hyperparameters, evaluate the model's performance, and search for the combination that yields the best results.

# 5. Integrate with Your Model:
Once the best hyperparameters are found, integrate them into your model and train the final model with the optimal hyperparameters.

Here is my Python script to fine-tune the CNN architecture with Keras Tuner.
